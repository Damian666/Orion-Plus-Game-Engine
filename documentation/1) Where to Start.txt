To begin using Orion for the first time, you will need to 
run the launcher at least once. This will download the
beginner assets you need to begin running orion.

From here, you will need to run the Server.exe and Client 
either from Visual Studio's debugger or by pressing Play 
from the launcher.

Create an account and then use the command-line in the
server to give yourself developer access. Type 'help'
without quotes for information on server commands.

At this point forward you are ready to begin developing
your first game in Orion!

If you do not wish to use the Launcher for your game you
can simply go to the "My Project" page located in the
Client project and go to the "Settings" tab and change
the Password field to just an empty string.

If you have previously used Orion you may wish to refer
to the "Recurring Users" folder documentation for any
information related to correcting assets that are no
longer compatible should you be bringing them from an
old project.
