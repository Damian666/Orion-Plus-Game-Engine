# **Orion+ Game Engine**

Orion is a Tile-Based 2D ORPG game engine. It targets new and advanced developers under the VB.net language with its 
simple and flexible systems. These systems offer a lot of power to expand gameplay far greater than its base while leaving
plenty of room to experiment and afford the performance loss for less experienced developers.

Currently Orion features a Client, Server, and Auto-Update/Launcher applications taking advantage of the powerful Winforms
Gui design.

The official Orion+ Engine repository can be found at [Orion+ Github](https://github.com/Damian666/Orion-Plus-Game-Engine/)
